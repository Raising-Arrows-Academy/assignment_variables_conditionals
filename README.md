# Variables and Conditional Statements Assignment

## About This Assignment

This assignment lets you practice what we learned in class about **variables** and **conditional statements** in Python. You'll write code to create variables, use them to store information, print them out, and then use conditional statements to make decisions based on those values.

**What You'll Learn:**

- How to create and use variables (strings, numbers, booleans)
- How to print variable values
- How to write if, elif, and else statements to make decisions in your code

**Your Task:**
Open `main.py` and follow the 3 steps outlined in the comments. Each step has clear instructions to guide you!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Your coding environment is already set up and ready to go. Everything you need is installed automatically!

**Your environment includes:**

- Python (ready to run your code)
- Python Test Explorer (to check your work with the beaker icon 🧪 in the sidebar)
- A Python Debugger (to step through code and find bugs)
- Auto-Formatting (your code looks clean when you save)

## 💻 Running Your First Program

Once your Codespace is ready:

1. Look for the file called `main.py` in the file explorer on the left
2. Click on it to open it
3. In the terminal at the bottom of the screen, type:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Press Enter
5. You should see: `Hello, World!`

**Congratulations!** You just ran your first Python program! 🎉

## ✅ Running Tests

Tests help make sure your code works correctly. You can run tests in two ways:

### Option 1: Using the Terminal (Command Line)

1. In the terminal, type:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
2. Press Enter
3. You should see that tests passed ✓

To see more details about what each test does:

```bash
pytest -v
```

### Option 2: Using the Test Explorer (Visual)

1. Click the beaker/flask icon 🧪 in the left sidebar (Testing)
2. You'll see a list of all your tests
3. Click the ▶️ play button next to a test to run it
4. Green checkmarks ✓ mean the test passed!
5. This is a great way to see which tests pass and which fail

**Tip:** The Test Explorer automatically discovers new tests when you save your files!

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Ask your teacher or classmates**
- **Try the code and see what happens** - It's okay to make mistakes!
- **Read error messages carefully** - They often tell you what's wrong

## 💡 Tips for Success

- Save your work often (it auto-saves, but you can also press `Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`)
- Run your code frequently to catch mistakes early
- Start small and build up - don't try to write everything at once
- If something doesn't work, try reading the error message - it usually gives you a hint!
