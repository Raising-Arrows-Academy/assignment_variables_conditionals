    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # STEP 1: 
    #   Create variables
    #
    # Instructions:
    #   You will need 3 variables to help you with this assignment
    #   placeholders are below indicating the variable and it's 
    #   data type that you should use.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------

    # store the member's name (string)  

    # store the number of books currently check out (number)

    # store whether the library account is active (boolean)


    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # STEP 2: 
    #   Print the member's information
    # 
    # Instructions:
    #   We want to PRINT the information for the member. You can 
    #   do this using the Python print function, see example below.
    #
    # Example:
    #   name = "Bob"
    #   print("Name:", name)
    #
    # ------------------------------------------------------------

    # print the member's name

    # print the number of books currently checked out

    # print whether the library account is active


    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # STEP 3: 
    #   Use conditional statements to check library rules
    # 
    # Instructions:
    #   Write conditional statements that check the library rules
    #     Rules:
    #       - The account must be active
    #       - A member can check out up to 5 books
    # 
    #   The expected result is PRINT using the print function, 
    #   to indicate if the member can checkout any more books
    #
    # ------------------------------------------------------------

    # conditional statement goes here to check library rules
    # You must use an if, elif, and else conditional statement

    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # here for display purposes
    print("=" * 75)
