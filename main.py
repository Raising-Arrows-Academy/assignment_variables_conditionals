"""
Main module for Python assignment.
This assignment demonstrates use of Variables and Conditional Statements.

Instructions:
  Below there are 3 steps outlines to be completed. Complete each
  step. You can run the example as often as you want to see the output.

  Be certain to COMMIT and SYNC your work often so that you do not
  lose any work you have done.

  If you run into any issues or have questions reach out to your instructor.

Running the example:
  In your terminal enter the following and press enter
  python main.py

Expected Output:
  Depending upon what values you set for your variables, your output should look
  similar to the following but does not have to be exact.

  Terminal $ python main.py
  ========================================================================
  Member Name: John Smith
  Books Checked Out: 3
  Account Active: True
  You can check out more books.
  ========================================================================

    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # STEP 1:
    #   Create variables
    #
    # Instructions:
    #   You will need 3 variables to help you with this assignment
    #   placeholders are below indicating the variable and it's
    #   data type that you should use.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------

    # store the member's name (string)
    name = "Kai"

    # store the number of books currently check out (number)
    number_of_books = 4

    # store whether the library account is active (boolean)
    account_active = True

    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # STEP 2:
    #   Print the member's information
    #
    # Instructions:
    #   We want to PRINT the information for the member. You can
    #   do this using the Python print function, see example below.
    #
    # Example:
    #   name = "Bob"
    #   print("Name:", name)
    #
    # ------------------------------------------------------------

    # print the member's name
    print("Member Name:", name)

    # print the number of books currently checked out
    print("Books Checked Out:", number_of_books)

    # print whether the library account is active
    print("Account Active:", account_active)

    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # STEP 3:
    #   Use conditional statements to check library rules
    #
    # Instructions:
    #   Write a compound conditional statement that checks the library rules
    #     Rules:
    #       - The account must be active
    #       - A member can check out up to 5 books
    #
    #   The expected result is PRINT using the print function,
    #   to indicate if the member can checkout any more books
    #
    #   The member cannot checkout a book if all rules are not met
    # ------------------------------------------------------------

    # conditional statement goes here to check library rules
    # You must use an if, elif, and else conditional statement
    
    if not account_active:
        print("You can NOT check out any books. You do not have an active account")
    elif number_of_books >= 5:
        print("You can NOT check out more books, you've reached the 5 book max")
    else:
        print("You can check out more books.")
